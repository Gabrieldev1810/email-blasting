## üîß Technical Implementation

### Email Tracking Mechanism
```python
# Tracking pixel implementation
@bp.route('/track/open/<tracking_id>', methods=['GET'])
def track_open(tracking_id):
    # Updates EmailLog.opened_at timestamp
    # Returns 1x1 transparent pixel
    # Handles caching with proper headers
```

### Click Tracking System
```python
# Link rewriting and redirect
@bp.route('/track/click/<tracking_id>', methods=['GET'])
def track_click(tracking_id):
    # Creates LinkClick record
    # Updates EmailLog.clicked_at timestamp
    # Redirects to original URL
```
